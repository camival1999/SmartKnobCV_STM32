# Development Tracking

Scribe-maintained documents tracking project progress, issues, and releases.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Phase definitions and task breakdowns |

| [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) | Active bugs, workarounds, resolved items |
| [PROGRESS/](PROGRESS/) | Detailed per-phase progress tracking |

## Conventions

- Dates use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Versions follow `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Progress files are named `phase-N-description.md`
- The Scribe agent updates these files after significant events
