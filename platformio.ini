; PlatformIO Project Configuration File
;
; NOTE: This file lives at the repo root so the PlatformIO VS Code extension
; detects the project automatically. The actual source code is in PoC/firmware/.
; See the [platformio] section below for directory mappings.
;
; In multi-root workspaces, PlatformIO only scans workspace folder roots
; for platformio.ini — it won't find it if nested in subdirectories.
